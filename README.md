# Description
Grass Invaders is a full-stack replica of the classic Space Invaders game. The app itself is fairly simple - you control a ship and shoot at monsters while they chase and shoot at you, and the game ends when a monster hits you. High scores are sent to and retrieved from a SQL database via a REST API.

Technical Stack:
  - Development: PostgreSQL | Express | React | Node.js
